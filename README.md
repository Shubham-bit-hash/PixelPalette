# PixelPalette ðŸŽ¨  

PixelPalette is a virtual color whiteboard that allows you to draw and paint dynamically using color markers detected through a webcam. With intuitive controls and real-time color tracking, you can unleash your creativity digitally.  

## Features  
- **Color Detection**: Adjust marker color settings using HSV values.  
- **Multi-Color Drawing**: Choose from Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow markers.  
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset the canvas with a simple click.  
- **Customizable Controls**: Adjust marker sensitivity using trackbars.  
- **Live Feedback**: See your drawing process in real-time across multiple windows.

## Usage  
1. **Run the program**:  
   ```bash
   python pixel_palette.py
   ```  
2. **Control Panel**:  
   - Use the **Color detectors** window to adjust HSV values for precise color detection.  
3. **Color Selection**:  
   - Click on the color buttons (Blue, Green, Red, Yellow) to switch marker colors.  
4. **Clear Canvas**:

## How It Works  
1. The program uses a webcam to detect markers based on HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color ranges.  
2. Detected marker positions are drawn on a virtual canvas in the selected color.  
3. Trackbars allow dynamic adjustment of HSV ranges for better color detection.  
4. Buttons on the top of the frame provide color selection and canvas clearing options.
